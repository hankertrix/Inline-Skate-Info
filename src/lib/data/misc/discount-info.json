    "You can only use the student discount at 4 skate shops, namely Hvper Sport / HiRoller, Ernsports, Inlinex and Mystic Skates. Hvper Sport / HiRoller and Ernsports only have discounts for skates on their catalogue, while Inlinex provides a 15% discount on all non-discounted skates. To obtain the student discount, it's quite likely that informing your skate club's president should be sufficient, but your club's president should be able to tell you the exact details. For NUS skaters, you'll have to bring your NUS student card for verification. For Mystic Skates, all you need to do is to upload your student card when filling in their purchase form to get a 10% discount on everything in their catalogue. Do note that the Mystic Skates catalogue shows the prices before the student discount is applied, unlike the other catalogues which show both the original and discounted price.",
    "Before heading down to the shops to buy your skates, do call them to check if they have the skates in your size. For Inlinex, you can check the stock on their website before heading down.",
    "Here are the details of the 4 places:"
