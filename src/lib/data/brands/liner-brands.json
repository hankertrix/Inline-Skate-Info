    "description": "MyFit is a sub-brand of Powerslide specialising in liners. Their liners are excellent and are a good upgrade to the stock liners that come with your skates. They are quite expensive, but it is probably worth it if you want more comfort out of your skates and don't want to pay the premium price for Intuition liners. Of course, MyFit liners would never match up to the far more pricey and premium Intuition liners, but they're great for their price. These liners are also one of the big reasons skaters choose to buy Powerslide and USD skates over skates from other brands, as they are more comfortable."
