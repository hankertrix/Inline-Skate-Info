    "description": "Mystic Skates is first and foremost a Singapore-based inline skating school, so it does not have a physical storefront or even a website. To purchase items from them, you will have to fill in a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://forms.gle/1Pjgv5UbnF34QNFH6\">form</a> and place a minimum deposit of $60 if your purchase is more than $60, and the full amount if your purchase amount is less than $60. You must also measure your feet and provide your running shoe's EU size if you purchase skates. They also offer a 10% discount for university students, which is claimed by uploading a picture of your matriculation card to the form. Their selection is quite decent, having more variety than most skate shops in Singapore, but nowhere near Inlinex's selection. They also sell higher quality and more expensive skates like those made of carbon fibre for lower prices than most skate shops, especially with the 10% student discount. You can peruse their catalogue <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://inline-skate-info.netlify.app/pdfs/mystic-skates-catalogue.pdf\">here</a>. The prices in the catalogue are retail prices, not discounted prices. They also have a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.carousell.sg/u/mystic_skates/\">Carousell</a> store, but it only sells a few accessories and a pair of cheap skates. If you are interested in what they are doing, you can check out their <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/mysticskates.sg/\">Instagram</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/mysticskates.sg/\">Facebook</a>."

    "description": "Pancit Sports is a Singaporean niche sports store and they sell all kinds of sports equipment, for sports like disc golf, ultimate frisbee, golf, boxing, and of course, skating. They are an official Micro distributor, and hence mostly stock Micro skates. This means that they only stock fitness and urban skates, as well as kids skates. They also stock Rollerblade and Cougar skates, but the ones they stock are for kids. They do have a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://shopee.sg/pancitsports#product_list\">Shopee</a> and a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.lazada.sg/pancit-sports/?q=All-Products&from=wangpu&langFlag=en&pageTypeId=2\">Lazada</a> online store if you would like to use those platforms to buy skates. They also have a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pancitsports/posts/pfbid029vYK77r8NGprKJDwLqu7rjviRZqrteoEdCHvmXJNqLKvFk4gJ7U3JvKtkbCfRLd1l?__cft__[0]=AZUs1WaFGlgmtQQF4von4XxnI1J2nFxzEER9tL_g8-sV5V9N2bA0yyNQrhSF08ySBwfk5WSrsAwRCEyfM5OtLip6uU02mRt0UtlsAGRkTY-dliH-l18m-BWXaDbNO46WJpkaAHFJ_25vTCkYhaBRnlPusJ42kIVUOp4DaAyGuR7Au0xsOIoMtMmR--saY7pCDY9fkzFuyk562uG87fVY2OuN&__tn__=%2CO%2CP-R\">10% discount</a> for people who are learning inline skating. In general, unless you absolutely must have a Micro skate or have that 10% discount, it's much better to visit a physical skate shop in Singapore instead of buying from here."

    "description": "Japy Skates is a Chinese Aliexpress store. While them being an Aliexpress store doesn't inspire confidence in the authenticity of their products, their products are legitimate and the prices line up with other skate shops, so there is no need to worry. They sell fitness, urban, speed and aggressive (called extreme on their store) skates. They also sell roller skates and ice skates, but the selection is pretty limited."

    "description": "Gogoskate is an online shop in the US that sells fitness, urban, speed and roller skates. They mostly stock Flying Eagle skates, with a few Freestyle skates, so the selection isn't great. If you're in Singapore, you should just buy from the Flying Eagle official store instead. You can also find Freestyle skates at most of the Singaporean skate shops. For some reason, their roller skates are unbranded as well, with no brand in the product name, but there are some that have their brand mentioned in the product description. The shop just seems a little sketchy. They did, however, send a Flying Eagle F4 Raven to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://youtu.be/IbaDv0CKe-4\">a skater on YouTube</a>, so maybe they aren't as sketchy as they seem, but that's up to you to decide."
