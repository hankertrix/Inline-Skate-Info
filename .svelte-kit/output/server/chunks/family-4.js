  description: "The powerslide is probably the first slide that you will learn since it is the easiest slide to do. It is also a highly effective stopping technique, especially if you need to stop quickly in an emergency as it has far more stopping power than the T-stop. To do the powerslide, you will first need to know how to skate backwards as well as to roll backwards on one skate. When you're skating backwards, put about 80% of your weight on one leg. We'll call this leg the supporting leg, and the other leg with the rest of your weight, the sliding leg. Be sure to bend your knee on the supporting leg to about 90Â° and keep your abdomen close to your thigh. Then, push the sliding leg out to the side until it is almost fully straightened and then bring it back behind you to initiate the slide. Your sliding leg should be fully straight when it is behind you. The motion of the sliding leg should look like carving a large C on the ground. While sliding, you shouldn't be turning to the left or the right and you should instead move in a straight line. If you are turning, that means that your sliding foot isn't sliding or the heel of the supporting foot has turned. As you get more comfortable with the powerslide, you should do the slide in slow motion so that you will have full control over the slide. You should also try varying the amount of weight you put on your sliding leg during the slide as well as the angle the sliding leg makes with the ground. The greater the amount of weight and the greater the angle between the sliding leg and the ground, the more friction you'll generate and you will stop faster. To learn how to control the amount of weight that you put on the sliding leg, instead of carving a large C on the ground with your sliding leg, try lifting your sliding leg and then placing it on the ground to initiate the powerslide. If you can easily lift and put down your sliding leg while sliding, then your control over the amount of weight you place on the sliding leg should be pretty good. To change the angle of your sliding leg, you just have to adjust how high your body is. The taller you stand up, the greater the angle between the sliding leg and the ground. Also, if you are intending to use the powerslide as a stopping technique, be sure to practice the powerslide on a downhill or a ramp as it will be vastly different from doing it on a flat surface. A carpark ramp should be a decent practice area that will get your powerslide ready for use during most downhills.",
